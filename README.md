<h1> This website was created on Django Framework. </h1>

I used here: 

+ HTML

+ CSS (No SCSS yet) + Bootstrap

+ JavaScript

<h2>My plans for this project are:</h2>

-  Fully Make front-end by myself

-  Add some SCSS and Tailwind CSS and learn it by using it in this project

- Fully make back-end

<h2>Useful links which helped me and can help others to develop a website's back-end/front-end</h2>
